breakdown of success and failures of different pledge drives based on categories and sub categories as well as number of donors and donation amounts

Based on the data we can see that in the parent category, Theater, Film & Video, and Music were the most successful in reaching their goals for donations. 
Those categories also ran the most fundraisers.
Though theater and most specifically plays had the most successful campaigns, they also had the most failed and canceled.
Data is limited in that we don't know promotion levels of the fundraisers and how donors were reached or canvased. It would be good to have a breakdown of how prospective donors were contacted to see how to best drive results.
Though we have a created and ended date for the pledge drives, a better graph would be one that takes into consideration duration of drives versus outcome. Does more time or less time help and crossed with time of year for when a drive might be most successful.
The breakdown could also work per category. Some times of year might be better than others based on category as well.


Summary of backers
mean is a better calculator between successful and unsuccessful campaigns in summarizing data. It shows that the more backers the better.
There is more variability with unsuccessful campaigns which makes sense because theirs a wider range of variants since the amount can go down to 0
